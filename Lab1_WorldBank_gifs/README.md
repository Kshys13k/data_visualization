A simple project implemented as part of learning data visualization tools. Based on data from the World Bank, I generated GIFs presenting changes in population from 1960 to 1921 in countries that in 2021 had:

    1. The 5 largest populations
    2. A population close to that of Indonesia
    3. A population close to that of Poland

(Source of data: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2021&start=1960&view=chart)

This project was prepared for the course "Data analysis and visualization"
at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics, University of Warsaw.
